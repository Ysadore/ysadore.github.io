<h4> February 2025 </h4>

							<p>In this article, we'll try and answer the subject question: does Path Of Exile's economy bear the charateristics of a perfectly competitive market economy? We'll be looking solely at the league economies to try and answer this question. </p>

<h2> Section 0: Introduction to <i>Path of Exile</i> and its economy</h2>
<h4> What is Path of Exile?</h4>
							<p>Path of Exile 1 (henceforth, PoE) is a free-to-play action role-playing game, developed by Grinding Gear Games. It was launched in 2013 and has maintained an active player base since. Players take the role of one of seven distinct classes, who fight monsters, develop their skills and follow an engaging story that leads them to fight the very gods themselves. It's a blast, and I would highly recommend it.</p>
<h4> What are Leagues?</h4>
<p>There is a fully persistent world in PoE, but most players play in Leagues. Leagues are different modes of playing. Broadly, there are two types of League: timed and persistent. Persistent Leagues are active forever and offer the base content. Timed Leagues run for a limited amount of time (usually around three months) and offer different mechanics for the players to interact with. These might include new areas, items, monsters and crafting options.  <br>
Items and characters cannot, for the most part, move between leagues, and as such each league has its own isolated economy. Additionally, when each league is launched all players start again afresh - the economy is forcibly reset. Any items, characters or wealth in a league cannot be taken into the next. This has some interesting economic implications, which we'll look at another time.</p>

<h4> How does currency work in PoE?</h4>
<p>In PoE, players will slay large numbers of monsters as they progress through the game. When slain, monsters will drop either items, which can be used on a character, or currency items. We're going to focus on currency items for this analysis. </p>
<p>Unlike many other games, there is no "money" as such - monsters don't drop gold coins. Instead they, drop a series of items that function like currency, but also have an additional use determined by the type of item it is. </p>
<p>For example, an <i>Orb of Transmutation</i> will upgrade a normal item into a magic one semi-randomly, and a <i>Regal Orb</i> will upgrade that magic item into a rare item, increasing its potency. The currency item is always consumed during its use. Additionally, some game processes allow some currency items to be converted from one type to another at specified ratios - for example, players can sell one <i>Orb of Fusing</i> in exchange for four <i>Jeweller's Orbs</i>. These conversions are not available for all currency types, though. </p>
<p>Unlike items, which display great variety and are often very close to unique, currency items are fully fungible. That is, the function of any given currency item is the same as any others in its class. All Regal Orbs are the same. The results when used still display randomness, but the items themselves are identical. This makes them perfect for trading between players. </p>

<h4> How does the player economy work in PoE?</h4>

<p>Currency items tend to be most useful in crafting, which allows players to assemble customised items themselves instead of relying on monster drops. But due to the semi-random nature of crafting, players may need to expend large amounts of different currency types to achieve an outcome they are satisfied with. </p>
<p>Because currency items are themselves useful beyond their role as a Store of Value and a Medium of Exchange, there is demand for all the items individually. This differs from real-world currency, where, for example, the demand for US cents is identical to the demand for US dollars. </p>
<p>Players can buy and sell to items and currency to each other. A number of different advertising mechanisms exist to conenct buyers and seller, not least the official trade site, <a href=https://www.pathofexile.com/trade> PoE Trade </a>. Here, players advertise their wares and desired prices, and allow players to meet in-game to perform the actual exchange. </p>
<p>The currency items drop at different frequencies. For example, <i> Scrolls of Wisdom </i> are very common, and most players will be able to meet their own demand just from playing the game. On the other hand, almost all players will never see a <i> Mirror of Kalandra </i> in-game, and the fortunate player who receives one from a random monster can be guaranteed to get a very high price for it. Because the rarer currency items are in general more useful, and the supply is correspondingly less, the prices are usually signifcantly higher. But how much higher is a product of player demand in different leagues, the age of league and many other factors. </p>

<h2> Section 1: What is a Perfectly Competitive Market Economy? And does PoE implement one?</h2>
<p>According to <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketeconomy.asp>Investopedia</a>, a Market Economy is one where supply and demand allow prices to reach their natural equilibrium, without major intervention from the state (or the developers, in our case). It should be fairly clear so far that PoE's player economy fulfils this condition already - players receive currency items, and prices are set by the player base in aggregate by the relative supply and demand. </p>
<p>That was easy! But now for a harder question: is it a Perfectly Competitive market? Let's turn to <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/perfectcompetition.asp>Investopedia</a> again.
A perfectly competitive market is one where:
<ul>
    <li>All firms sell an identical product. It's a commodity or homogeneous.</li>
    <li>All firms are price takers. They can't influence the market price of their products.    </li>
    <li>Market share doesn't influence prices.    </li>
    <li>Buyers have complete or perfect information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm in the past, present, and future.</li>
    <li>Capital resources and labor are perfectly mobile.</li>
    <li>Firms can enter or exit the market without cost.</li>
</ul>
Let's have a look at each of these in turn. </p>

<h4> Homogenous Products </h4>
<p>All PoE's currency markets, all players are selling the same product(s) - as identified above, all currency items are fungible. The item markets are substantially different, but that's out of scope for now. <br><b>Assessment</b>: criterion met. </p>

<h4> Price Taking and Price Influence</h4>
<p>I'll group these two because they're subject to the same factors in-game. This is fairly close to truth - individual players (firms) are price takers, and no player has the capability to determine the price for the market. There are three further factors to consider, though:
<ol>
    <li>There are some fixed prices in the market, provided by the vendors mentioned above. For example, the price of an <i>Orb of Fusing</i> will never rise above the equivalent of four <i>Jeweler's Orbs</i>. Why? Because at that point, it is more efficient for the player to use the guaranteed vendor trade. These interventions are a little like state price caps and floors - they prevent the price from fluctuating out of control. However, it is worth noting that this is probably not the intention of the availability of these trades though; but rather to ensure that players who don't want to use the player markets can convert basic types of currency. Nevertheless, an interesting case of player experience design decisions having economic impacts.</li>
    <li>Some items are rare enough that when sold, that sale represents a very high proportion of the market for that item. For example, the aforementioned <i>Mirror of Kalandra</i> is exceptionally rare; at time of writing, only <b>x</b> are available on the market. A player in this position has a relatively high degree of control over the price at which they wish to sell their item. However, these items are very much the exception, rather than the rule. </li>
    <li>Persistent reports of price fixing plague the market (<a href=https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2828075>1</a>, <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/6tiitc/psa_market_manipulation_at_its_finest/>2</a>, <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/c3vjsi/price_fixing_and_market_manipulation_are_the/>3</a>). In these cases, players advertise multiple trades of currency, but never actually accept any offers to trade at that price. They also offer the currency at a higher than market price, and when frustrated players ask for this, they respond and sell the currency, having got a distinctly better rate than the market. They can then sell the item back at market prices, and have achieved gain for no risk. </li></ol>
In general, the market actors in Poe are fairly close to price takers, but market distortions and inefficiencies do exist. 
<br>
GGG has declined to implement an auction-house like system for PoE, whereby players advertising an item effectively bind themselves to sell the item at the end of the auction. Doing so would remove the possibility for price fixing like that above. However, it is reported that GGG views the market imperfections it allows as a net benefit to them game, by making it slightly less easy to buy one’s way to very strong items.
<br>
<i>GGG have added an auction house to PoE 2, so we’ll see how this develops. </i>
    <br><b>Assessment</b>: pretty close, but not quite. </p>

<h4> Perfect Information </h4>
<p>All players have visibility of the boards where players advertise their proposed trades, and websites like poe.nina (which we'll be using for our analysis later) aggregate the prices to give averages, price history, trends, and much more. As such, player information for currency trades is generally high. It is only undercut by the price fixing behavoiour mentioned above, which obfuscates to most players the true price by a small margin.
    <br><b>Assessment</b>: pretty close, but with some imperfections creeping in. </p>

<h4> Mobility of Capital and Labour </h4>
<p>This one translates relatively poorly to PoE's game economy. There is only one market a character will have access to at once; as noted above, items cannot move between leagues, and in each league there is effectively only one market.
However, approached from a different lens, players are freely able to take up different 'roles' in the economy - players can focus on 'farming' currencies of certain types with specific areas of enemies, decline to trade at all if the prices are above their desired range, or trade intensively and use arbitrage and other market imperfections to make money.
    <br><b>Assessment</b>: Within the context of a game, implemented relatively well. </p>

<h4> Entering and Exiting the Market </h4>
<p>There are two aspects here - on the one hand, the game is free-to-play, so there are literally no costs to start interacting with the market. Likewise, it is fundamentally a game, and players (and their accumulated resources) can and do leave the market (by not playing) frequently. On the other hand, a player's wealth ingame is primarily a function of the time spent playing and their skill (to defeat powerful enemies or correctly price rare and valuable items), so a new player cannot transfer endowment from another game into PoE's market. It is possible to buy in-game currency with real-world currency using grey-market services, but this is not an official part of the game and market.
    <br><b>Assessment</b>: Criterion met. </p>

<h3> The Unusual Part - Leagues </h3>
<p> The major interaction not covered here is the League mechanic. After a temporary League has ended (the ones we have been largely talking about thus far), all items and currency within are moved to one of the persistent Leagues, like Standard or Hardcore Standard. Thus, when the next temporary League starts, all players enter with no endowment of currency, regardless of their position and wealth in the previous. All players encounter new content at approximately the same pace, and for the first few days demand for all items is very high, and supply is very low, leading to market conditions decidedly unlike the rest of the league (<i>I’ve got an analysis of this behaviour coming soon </i>). <br>
As such, currency is only a store of value within the League, and we cannot observe the long-term market trends in such short-term economies. Nevertheless, during the period they are active, the temporary League economies still exhibit market conditions and interactions.
</p>

<h2> Summary and Conclusion </h2>
<p> PoE's temporary League currency markets do a decent job of modelling a perfectly competitive market. Economists like to observe that no market exhibits truly perfect competition, and PoE also shows some imperfections, such as price fixing, and arbitrage using bots. However, for a game economy it does show strong market characteristics in a way many games do not, and players interact with it in a similar manner to a real-world market. 
<br>
In my opinion, that’s a real achievement for a game as complex as Path of Exile. It also achieves a great balance, whereby players can happily ignore player markets altogether if they like and still enjoy the game at its fullest (unlike, say EVE Online), but those that do wish to have access to emergent content and all the joy and frustration that brings.
